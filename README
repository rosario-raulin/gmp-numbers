gmp-numbers is a wrapper around the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library
(GMP) for (Open) Dylan.

The library is called gmp-numbers and currently exports the following modules:

    gmp-integer.

For more information about GMP, take a look at http://gmplib.org.

gmp-integer:
---

To create an instance of <gmp-integer>, you use make-integer() which
gets either an <integer> or a <string> and will allocate everything
for you automatically.

The following operations are currently implemented:

    +
    -
    *
    /
    ^
    <
    >
    =
    <=
    >=
    abs
    zero?
    negative.

There's also a with-integer macro that you call like this:

	with-integer(num = "25")
	  format-out("%=\n", num + num);
	end with-integer;

The reason this macro exists is that <gmp-integer>s need to be deallocated
manually by calling destroy-integer() on them. This macro does the job for you
automatically even if something bad happens (like the occurrence of an 
exception).
